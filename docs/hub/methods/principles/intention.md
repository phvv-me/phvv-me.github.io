# Intention

Human existence is defined by actions. However, not all actions are created equal. Some are voluntary, born from conscious intention, while others are involuntary, driven by habit or instinct. Involuntary actions are often automatic responses, habits ingrained through repetition or triggered by internal and external cues. Consider the involuntary flinch when a loud noise erupts, or the habitual route we take home from work without conscious thought. These actions, while efficient, are not born of conscious will. Voluntary actions, in contrast, are characterized by intention. They are deliberate, purposeful movements driven by a desired outcome. Taking a walk to clear one's head, for instance, is a voluntary action, imbued with the intention of achieving mental clarity. It is in these intentional actions that we find the seeds of self-regulation and identity formation.

Intention demands a desired state - a goal - executed through concrete behaviors, which reflect our aspirations, our values, and our vision of who we want to become. Imagine a young professional striving to build a career in law. Their intention to study diligently, network effectively, and hone their legal skills is directly tied to their desired identity as a successful lawyer. When our actions align with these intentions, we experience a sense of purpose and fulfillment, a feeling of being true to ourselves. This alignment reinforces our sense of integrity and strengthens the foundations of our chosen identity.

Nevertheless, when you eat that burger just after starting a diet, is that intentional or involuntary? Technically, you made a conscious decision when you ordered the meal, but the action itself was automatic, driven by habit or impulse. There lies the fact that we can also be misaligned with our intentions. If we act in ways that contradict our values or undermine our aspirations, we experience inner conflict and a sense of dissonance. Consider someone who values kindness and compassion but is consistently in environments of gossip and judgmental behavior. This misalignment erodes their sense of integrity, creating a gap between their desired self and their actual actions, leading to a diminished well-being.

The path to a more intentional life lies in cultivating self-regulation: the ability to critically yet compassionately observe ourselves and manage our attention, emotions, and behaviors to reach the desired state. In this regard, 3 principles stand out:

## Self-Awareness

The ability to understand our inner landscape – our thoughts, feelings, and motivations – and to recognize the cues that trigger both voluntary and involuntary behaviors. 

To that end, clarity is essential. Vague goals and intentions are easily lost in the noise of daily life. Instead of a nebulous desire to "be healthier" or "get thin this year", prefer clear, specific, and measurable intentions, such as "I will incorporate vegetables into every meal," provides a concrete target, making it easier to track progress and maintain motivation.

For example, journaling can be a powerful technique for enhancing self-awareness. Regularly reflecting on our actions, motivations, and feelings in writing allows us to identify patterns, understand our triggers, and gain clarity about our true intentions. Similarly, engaging in mindfulness practice, through meditation or simply paying attention to the present moment, cultivates a non-judgmental awareness of our inner experience, fostering a deeper understanding of our thoughts and emotions and their influence on our actions. Value alignment is another critical component of self-awareness. When our intentions are rooted in our core values, we experience a deeper sense of purpose and meaning. For instance, an entrepreneur who values honesty and transparency will likely have a stronger intention to build a business based on ethical practices, experiencing a sense of fulfillment that extends beyond mere financial success. Therapy, in its various forms, can also be a valuable tool for increasing self-awareness, providing a structured and supportive space to explore our inner world, identify patterns of behavior, and clarify our values and intentions.


## Self-Control

Self-Control, the second principle, is the capacity to align our actions with our intentions, especially when faced with distractions or temptations. Implementation intentions are a powerful technique for enhancing self-control. By pre-planning when, where, and how we will act, we bypass the need for conscious willpower in the moment. Imagine someone struggling to establish a consistent exercise routine. Instead of simply relying on willpower to overcome the inertia of a sedentary lifestyle, they can form an implementation intention: "When I finish work each day (situation x), I will immediately change into my workout clothes and go for a run (response y)." This creates a direct link between a specific cue and the desired behavior, making action initiation more automatic and efficient. Visualization is another technique that strengthens self-control. By mentally rehearsing successful enactment of desired behaviors, we strengthen the neural pathways associated with those behaviors and build confidence in our ability to act intentionally. Imagine a public speaker visualizing themselves delivering a compelling and confident presentation; this mental rehearsal can significantly enhance their actual performance. Finally, seeking support and accountability from others can bolster self-control. Surrounding ourselves with individuals who share similar goals and values creates a supportive environment that reinforces our intentions and provides encouragement during challenging times. Joining a running group, for example, can provide the accountability and support needed to maintain a consistent exercise routine.

## Self-Determination

Self-Determination, the third principle, highlights the importance of intrinsic motivation in sustaining intentional action and shaping a congruent identity. Intrinsic motivation, driven by inherent interest and satisfaction, is far more potent than extrinsic motivation, fueled by external rewards or pressures. When our intentions are self-determined, aligned with our autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, we are more likely to sustain effort and persevere in the face of obstacles. For example, someone who chooses to learn a new language out of genuine curiosity and a desire for personal growth (intrinsic motivation) will likely be more persistent in their studies than someone who learns a language solely to fulfill a job requirement (extrinsic motivation). Cultivating self-determination involves consciously choosing goals and intentions that are personally meaningful and intrinsically rewarding, fostering a sense of autonomy and ownership over our actions and identity.

Ultimately, the conscious and skillful application of these principles and techniques empowers us to actively participate in the ongoing project of shaping our identities. By cultivating self-awareness, we gain clarity about our values and aspirations. By developing self-control, we learn to align our actions with our intentions. And by embracing self-determination, we ensure that our intentions are rooted in our authentic desires and contribute to a life of purpose and fulfillment. Through this conscious and intentional process, we become not merely creatures of habit or circumstance, but the architects of our own destinies, weaving intention into the very fabric of our being.

Principles:

- Self-Awareness
- Self-Control
- Self-Determination: Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity because it is interesting and satisfying to do so, as opposed to doing an activity to obtain an external goal (i.e., from extrinsic motivation) - autonomy, competence, and relatedness

Techniques:

- increase Self-Awareness:

- Clarity: A vague goal, like "I want to be healthier," is unlikely to yield significant results. A clear, specific, and measurable intention, such as "I will walk for 30 minutes three times a week," provides a concrete target for action and allows for progress to be tracked, fostering motivation.

- Value Alignment: a person who values honesty and integrity will likely have a stronger intention to refrain from dishonesty in professional dealings, allowing us to experience a deeper sense of meaning and fulfillment.

- Therapy

- Journaling

- Mindfulness practice

- increase Self-Control:

- Implementation: planning when, where, and how one will enact the desired behavior. Instead of just stating a goal, a person forms a plan such as, "When I feel stressed at work (situation x), I will take a 5-minute walk (response y)." This technique bypasses the decision fatigue that often derails good intentions by linking the action to a specific cue.

- visualization: Seeing ourselves successfully enacting the desired behavior, or achieving the desired outcome, can significantly increase our likelihood of doing so. This mental rehearsal strengthens the neural pathways associated with the behavior and builds confidence.

- support / accountability: Surrounding oneself with individuals who share similar goals and values creates a supportive environment that reinforces positive intentions and provides encouragement during challenging times.

- Goal: Consciously form an identity
