# How to beat the Comfort Zone:

Is the Comfort Zone a real thing?

This is a concept from the 1990s that was popularized by management consultant Alasdair White.
He used this idea to understand performance under stress.
In Wikipedia, we find the Confort Zone is "a behavioural state within which a person operates in an anxiety-neutral condition".
But let's try to understand this more easily.

Games usually have these bars that limit your character actions. 
That stamina gauge depleting as you sprint or swing your sword.
They translate the real-world experience of fatigue into an intuitive visual interface. 
It makes characters more relatable and real, but I always asked myself: is the stamina gauge real?
Is that how our body works?
It turns out that there is a gauge, one that influences everything from our health to our focus, but it's not as simple as a bar.
But just like games, we can upgrade our stamina gauge and push it beyond our usual limits.

You resist the donut at breakfast, 
power through a tough meeting, 
and by evening, you just don't have the willpower left for that workout you planned. 
So you collapse on the couch, 
thinking "I just can't do it today."
If you ever heard of "ego depletion", this is it. 
Your stamina bar is empty.
You spent all your mental energy on work, and now there is no willpower left.

Actually, the science behind ego depletion is shaky.
The real answer is more nuanced.

In 2016, a massive study involving 23 laboratories tried to replicate the ego depletion effect and couldn't find consistent evidence for it. This sparked a major rethinking of how willpower actually works.
What science shows us now is that your mental stamina bar isn't a simple depleting resource - it's more dynamic, like advanced game mechanics with multiple factors.

Think of your willpower gauge having three zones:

1. **Comfort Zone**: Where you operate without much effort
2. **Growth Zone**: Where you're pushing yourself but still sustainable
3. **Burnout Zone**: Where pushing further leads to negative consequences

Here's what's fascinating - most of us rarely hit true burnout. 
Instead, our brain creates an illusion of depletion as a protective mechanism.
What is bonkers to me, is that people who believe willpower is unlimited show fewer depletion effects!
Essentially, if you think your stamina bar recharges quickly, it actually does!
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20876879/

But there is more, the idea of depleted willpower is in reality a shift in motivation.
After you exert self-control, your brain recalibrates its priorities:
- Decreased motivation for effort
- Increased motivation for rewards
- Reduced attention to tasks requiring discipline

Think about it like this: You claim you're too exhausted to workout, 
but if someone offered you $10,000 to hit the gym right now, you'd probably find the energy.

Therefore, you never ran out of willpower or stamina, 
your brain is just saving energy for something more rewarding. 
Something that matters more to you.
You may think you fool me, but you can't fool yourself. 
You never can.

You can't lie about your own identity in a way to contradict yourself.
Actually, lying to yourself only makes things worse.
It makes your stamina gauge recharges slower because you start feeling you are not capable.
That is called "Competence", the feeling we are able to succeed in our tasks and intentions.
But that is not the only factor: 
while in games stamina regenerates automatically over time,
in real life, our willpower replenishes if we feel the tasks have purpose (Meaning) and that we are acting by choice (Autonomy).

However, it is just impossible to feel competent, autonomous and meaningful all the time. 
Some people just go through this like a grind and try to push through.
But again, this is just a way to burn yourself out. 

That's not what I want for you or me, 
so here are a few ways we can reach the growth zone easily:

1. Implementation Intentions is the simplest technique. 
But it is actually known to increase intention-action alignment by up to 300%. 
Get a piece of paper, and write a place, a time, and a behavior. 
Be specific.
Instead of "I'll workout more," use: "If it's 6pm on Monday, then I'll do 30 minutes of strength training."
Do that everyday and you will see the results.
But understand this works because it bypasses the decision-making process that drains willpower.
That's right: uncertainty on what you should do next can massively drain your stamina gauge.
So after you write it down, don't think about it, just do it.

2. Sleep!
At least 8 hours!
"Oh, but I have so much to do! It's a waste of time to sleep 8 hours!"
Waste of time is trying to do anything when you're feeling like a zombie, taking 3 hours to write an email.
Sleep isn't downtime.
It's literally when your brain recharges.
Sleep-deprived people have reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex
the part of your brain responsible for self-control
Seven to nine hours of quality sleep isn't lazy; 
it's strategic. 
Just like you wouldn't start a boss fight with depleted stats, 
don't tackle important challenges without proper recovery.

Just kidding, but seriously, it helps a lot.

3. Design your environment.
A big source of willpower drain is resisting temptations.
So, remove them.
If you want to eat healthier, don't keep junk food in the house.
If you want to cut down on social media, delete the apps from your phone.
You're not weak for avoiding temptation; you're smart.

4. Stack your Habits.
This one takes a bit more of work
but it's damn effective
because if you can transform an intention into a habit,
you won't need willpower to do it.
Research shows new habits take about 66 days to form.
but if you attach new behaviors to existing ones,
you can speed this up.
For example: "After I brush my teeth, I'll do 10 pushups."
This uses the completion of one habit as the trigger for another.
But remember, you need the first habit to be strong.
So, if you're not brushing your teeth regularly,
maybe start there.

Your mental stamina gauge isn't fixed
it's upgradeable. 
The science shows that willpower isn't simply depleted by use; 
it fluctuates based on motivation, meaning, and our beliefs.
Instead of thinking "I am too tired for gym today" try "I'm conserving my energy for what matters."
This isn't just positive thinking
research shows that believing in limited willpower significantly impacts our capacity.

That's why I have a whole video on intention,
so make sure to check it out.

Thank you for watching,
bye bye.
