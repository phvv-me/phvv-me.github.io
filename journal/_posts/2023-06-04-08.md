title: eppur si muove!

It still astonishes me when the ground shakes. It happens quite frequently, so much that many don't notice it anymore. In physics, most regularly, the ground is the reference frame and thus it is immovable, so that might be why I take it as so surreal that the ground it self can move. It sure makes the physics even more real. It also makes Japan more real.

It has been 8 months I've been here, and I come to think how much I yet have to experience. I don't know if there will be time, if there will ever be time. The fact it amazes me so much also leads me to think how much time do I wish to stay here. Once I told myself 10 years would be good, but that is so much time, and yet insufficient.

I don't have much to say, in the end. Just that, for now, it still astonishes me when the ground shakes.
