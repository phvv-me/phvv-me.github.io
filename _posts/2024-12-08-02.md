As we approach the end of another year, it becomes customary to reflect on what we have accomplished. The weight of expectation we place on our shoulders can often feel heavier than the world itself. I know I feel anxious when asked about yearly achievements, but this time I want to try and find genuine fulfillment.

Instead of getting lost in long-term goals that might seem unreachable, start considering what you want to achieve in a day. Daily intentions ground you, providing a sense of control and accomplishment. For example, what tasks must you complete today? 
And then, what about the week ahead? And the month? And then finally the year?

Understanding that your year is an accumulation of daily actions can change your perspective. It shifts the focus from far-off dreams to immediate, achievable things. For me, I want to grow my YouTube channel this year, and I was thinking I would like to have 1000 subscribers, but this is not the right focus. This is not **controllable** and neither something doable in a single day. That's why I will be focusing on **consistency**, on creating content at a steady pace. Control what you can: your output and efforts.

### Incremental Progress

This shift I believe can help me understand this as a long journey without an end goal -- an infinite game -- one I only have to play while I want. In that sense, accomplishing a task today makes tomorrow’s steps less daunting. Yet, in the pursuit of these daily tasks, allow yourself the freedom to pivot. If a project or hobby no longer brings joy, do not bind yourself to it. It’s okay to abandon an unfinished book or pause YouTube if it no longer fulfills you. 

Life should not be bounded to material things. It should be bound to your own sake and pursue of happiness. And to that, there are alternate routes to happiness.

### On 2025

As we gaze toward 2025, let's nurture habits of setting weekly intentions. Lessen the burden and remember it compassionately to a fulfilling and meaningful year. Each week, ask yourself, "What do I want to work on?" And let that guide you. There is freedom in allowing yourself to work towards goals that bring day-to-day satisfaction. 

See you on the journey ahead!
