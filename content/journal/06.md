title: I'm back! 😎
---

I missed you too, my dear reader. 

I can already feel the online crowd embracing me on my online return. Unfortunately I haven't really found an excuse for my disappearance, but I found something definitely better: **a job!** 🕺 Yeah, I am working as a backend developer. It's been great 🤑, thanks for asking. 

This is a short blog post just to say that I'm finally adapted to the new routine and I want to write in here more often. It is good to be back 😎.
