I hope I can keep my focus.

I am still trying to decide what subjects should I start writing my posts. It is true it would be simpler to make it about something I already know, but today some news I read sparked an interest to start a series about Rust, a low-level programming language that has been gaining some attention in the last couple years.

The [TIOBE index or TIOBE Programming Community index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages that is updated once every month and the June 2020 data has just been released. The headline for this month is that Rust has reached the Top 20 for the first time. They highlight as well that, for the fourth year in a row, the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey has shown Rust](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) to be the "the most loved programming language". Thus, I take this as a sign that this language has to be checked out!
