<!-- use poker as an example - use poker images -->

As I was watching a video today about thermodynamics and entropy, I decided to further investigate the issue of what I call the _scarcity of meaning_ in the universe. Be advised that this text is nothing more than digression and will most certainly be filled with some jibber jabber. Now disclaimed, I, thus, dare to begin.

In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, we usually model the physics of a system with **states** and **transformations**. Particularly, on statistical mechanics, we further split these states into **microstates** and **macrostates**: for one single **macrostate**, we may have tons of possible **microstates**. For instance, if I tell you I have a container at $100 ºF$ containing $10^23$ oxygen atoms, there are an enormous amount of _microstates_ (set of positions and velocities) that these atoms could be arranged to that would get me the same degree of temperature (macrostate). There so, we could _extrapolate_ this reality and try to look it with a more abstract approach.

I am going to reassign the idea of **macrostate** to the concept of **meaning**, as in _the meaning of a word_, and the idea of **microstate** to the concept of **configuration**. Besides, let's also extrapolate the concept of a **system**, so that it does not have to be something physical. With that in mind, let me make an example so that things don't get out of hand.

Suppose the **system** to be the _universe of possible sounds_ and a **configuration** could be a specific sound (I could put some constraints here, but let's avoid the complexity). Therefore, we could take the **meaning** to be that of the english word _yes_. In portuguese, we say _sim_, german, _ja_, japanese, _はい_ (hai), and so on. If we are talking about the _meaning of yes_, we would have as many possible sounds as the languages the human species has ever created. On the other hand, we could have an almost infinite amount of sounds.
